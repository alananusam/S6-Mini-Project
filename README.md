# SerenadeBot S6-Mini-Project
SerenadeBot
In our project, we aim to enhance music discovery and stress relief by leveraging advanced technology. So, we wish to create a chatbot-driven music recommendation system by integrating the last.fm API with a trained chatbot, we create a system that recommends music based on the user's mood expressed in their conversation with the chatbot. We achieve this by analyzing the tone and detecting emotions using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and other APIs for NLP (Natural Language Processing) with Python. This innovative approach allows users to discover soothing music tailored to their emotions, ultimately providing a personalized and immersive listening experience.

To Run the program download the repository locally and run Python file app.py
